Arithmetic package for the [Fōrmulæ](https://formulae.org) framework, in JavaScript.

Fōrmulæ is a set of programs for visualization, edition and manipulation of complex expressions, from many fields. The programming of an specific field —i.e. arithmetics— is encapsulated in a single unit called a Fōrmulæ **package**.

This repository contains the source code for the **arithmetic package**, in Javascript.

The GitHub organization [formulae-org](https://github.com/formulae-org) encompasses the source code for the rest of packages, as well as the [main program](https://github.com/formulae-org/formulae-js).

Take a look at this [tutorial](https://formulae.org/?script=tutorials/Arithmetic) to know the capabilities of the Fōrmulæ arithmetic package.
